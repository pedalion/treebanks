# treebanks
The following treebanks were developed by following the guidelines of the Perseus Dependency Treebanks. See also en.pedalion.org.

##  Papyri texts
**What?** The texts will be offered to the Sematia project. 

**Who?** Most texts were annotated by Alek Keersmaekers. A number of texts were annotated by Louis Verreth (based on a first automated parsing by Alek Keersmaekers), and singular contributions were made by KU Leuven undergraduate students of Greek in the academic years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, partly based on a first automated parsing by Alek Keersmaekers. In alphabetical order: . The entire annotation process is supervised by Alek Keersmaekers. More details can be found in the corresponding xml-file.

**How much?** First release: ca. 7K tokens.

**Updates?**  The annotations of the students of 2018-2019 will added in the course of January 2019. 

## The Pedalion example sentences

**What?** Pedalion.org offers a modular grammar of Ancient Greek. The English version, en.pedalion.org, is still under construction. This grammar relies on a high number of original example sentences, a large number of which were treebanked.

**Who?** Supervised by Toon Van Hal. Most sentences were annotated by Toon Van Hal, all of which are based on a first automated parsing by Alek Keersmaekers. 

**How much?** First release: ca. 11K tokens.

**Updates?** Student contributions will be added in the course of January 2019. The metadata of the sentences will also be enhanced.

## Lucian, *Prometheus*

**What?** Lucian, Prometheus on Caucasus, in: Lucian: Works with an English Translation by. A. M. Harmon. Cambridge, MA. Harvard University Press. London. William Heinemann Ltd. 1915. 2. Via: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.

**Who?** Supervised by Toon Van Hal, with student contributions by De Schutter, A.; Knapen, C.; Weets, C.; Van Nunen, E.; De Smet, Isabeau; Van Bever, L.; Valadou, M.; De Backer, Olympe; Keupers, S.; Vangenechten, Thomas; Valgaeren, Thomas; Nelis, Tilke.

**How much?** ca. 2,5K tokens.
 
## Lysias, *on the pension* (Or. 24)

**What?** Lysias (Or. 24) with an English translation by W.R.M. Lamb, M.A. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1930.

**Who?** Annotated by Louis Verreth, on the basis of an automatically parsed version by Alek Keersmaekers. 

**How much?** ca. 1,5K tokens.

## Modifications in the Perseus Dependency Treebanks of Ancient Greek

**What?** This database-generated list contains a number of  the existing Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks. We are currently conducting experiments with automated parsing of Greek, and we are therefore attempting to homogenize the training corpus. The modifications included are of a manifold nature. The number of what we believe are clear mistakes is just a minor -- although not unsubstantial -- part of the file: most suggestions are made for purposes of homogenization. Later versions of this file will likely qualify the nature of each modification made. As this is work in progress, it is safe to say that this file might also contain a number of improvements for the worse. 

The modifications are implemented in our own treebank search device, DendroSearch.

**Who?** Toon Van Hal and Alek Keersmaekers. 

**How much?** The first version contains modifications of ca. 70K tokens.

## Credits

For our experiments with automated analysis, we thankfully rely on the high number of treebanks readily available
* Perseus Treebanks: https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/
* PROIEL Treebanks: https://proiel.github.io/
* The Gorman Treebanks: https://github.com/rgorman/Greek_Dependency_Treebanks
* Harrington's Treebanks: https://perseids-project.github.io/harrington_trees/.
* The Sematia Project: https://github.com/ezhenrik/sematia

Our treebank data was created and edited through the help of the Arethusa application (https://github.com/alpheios-project/arethusa) as provided by the Perseids Project at Tufts University (https://perseids.org). Arethusa has received support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Tufts University, and the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at Leipzig. Arethusa is now being jointly maintained by the Perseids Project at Tufts University and The Alpheios Project, Ltd.

# treebanks
The following treebanks (all of which are bèta-versions) were developed by following the guidelines of the Perseus Dependency Treebanks. See also en.pedalion.org. (NB: For experimental reasons, some trees exhibit the part-of-speech designation 'b', equalling in most cases 'd' or 'c').

##  Papyri texts
**What?** All papyri texts, which will be offered to the Sematia project, are annotated with Trismegistos-id's (both on the text level and on the word level).   

**Who?** Alek Keersmaekers is the principle annotator of this corpus. A number of texts were annotated by Louis Verreth (based on a first automated parsing by Alek Keersmaekers). In addition, there are student contributions, partly based on a first automated parsing by Alek Keersmaekers, by Anna Bloemen; Mathieu Cuijpers; Niels De Ridder; Sanderijn Gijbels; Yoran Joosten; Yordi Lenaerts; Jonas Roose; Tibo Schuermans; Eva Uffing; Chiara Van der Hasselt; Lisa Vanhee; Jolien Volders; Anne-Sophie Vounckx (KU Leuven undergraduate students of Greek in the academic years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019). The entire annotation process is supervised by Alek Keersmaekers. More details can be found in the corresponding xml-file.

**How much?** Currently ca. 12K tokens.

**First release?** 2018

**Updates?**  February 2019: addition of student annotations. 

## The Pedalion example sentences

**What?** Pedalion.org offers a modular grammar of Ancient Greek. The English version, en.pedalion.org, is still under construction. This grammar relies on a high number of original example sentences, a large number of which have been treebanked.

**Who?** Supervised by Toon Van Hal. Most sentences were annotated by Toon Van Hal, all of which are based on a first automated parsing by Alek Keersmaekers. In addition, there are student contributions by Mathieu Cuijpers; Sanderijn Gijbels; Yoran Joosten; Yordi Lenaerts; Eva Uffing; Chiara Van der Hasselt; Lisa Vanhee; Jolien Volders; Anne-Sophie Vounckx (each student encoded ca. 300 tokens).

**How much?** Currently ca. 14K tokens.

**First release?** 2018

**Updates?** February 2019: addition of student annotations; correction of previous data | Still to be done: The metadata of the sentences will  be enhanced.

## Modifications in the Perseus Dependency Treebanks of Ancient Greek

**What?** This database-generated list contains a number of  the existing Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks. We are currently conducting experiments with automated parsing of Greek, and we are therefore attempting to homogenize the training corpus. The modifications included are of a manifold nature. The number of what we believe are clear mistakes is just a minor -- although not unsubstantial -- part of the file: most suggestions are made for purposes of homogenization. Later versions of this file will likely qualify the nature of each modification made. As this is work in progress, it is safe to say that this file might also contain a number of improvements for the worse. 

The modifications are implemented in our own treebank search device, DendroSearch.

**Who?** Toon Van Hal and Alek Keersmaekers. 

**How much?** The first version contains modifications of ca. 70K tokens.

## Credits

For our experiments with automated analysis, we thankfully rely on the high number of treebanks readily available
* Perseus Treebanks: https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/
* PROIEL Treebanks: https://proiel.github.io/
* The Gorman Treebanks: https://github.com/rgorman/Greek_Dependency_Treebanks
* Harrington's Treebanks: https://perseids-project.github.io/harrington_trees/.
* The Sematia Project: https://github.com/ezhenrik/sematia

Our treebank data was created and edited through the help of the Arethusa application (https://github.com/alpheios-project/arethusa) as provided by the Perseids Project at Tufts University (https://perseids.org). Arethusa has received support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Tufts University, and the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at Leipzig. Arethusa is now being jointly maintained by the Perseids Project at Tufts University and The Alpheios Project, Ltd.

Since January 2019, this work is also partly funded through an FWO research grant (Research Foundation Flanders).
